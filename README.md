To use, set up a Travis CI account with the username (the username of the Reddit user to update the AutoModerator config), password (the password of the aforemetioned user), client ID and client secret (see https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-get-client_id-and-client_secret-for-python-reddit-api-registration/), and subreddit (the subreddit to update the AutoModerator config for). By default, config.yaml is used for the file to import and "Automatic Automoderator Deployment" is used as the User Agent string; these two can be changed using the configfile and UASTRING environment variables respectively.
